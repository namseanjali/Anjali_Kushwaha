**1\. Introduction to Open Source**

The term **Open-source** is closely related to Open-source software . Open-source software is a type of computer software that is released under a license, but the source code is made available to all the users. The copyright holders of such software allow the users to use it and do some valuable modifications in its source code to add some new features, to improve the existing features, and to fix bugs if there are any. Because of this reason only Open-source software is mostly developed collaboratively.

**Some famous examples of Open-source products are :**

* **Operating systems –**  
   Android, Ubuntu, Linux  
* **Internet browsers –**  
   Mozilla Firefox, Chromium  
* **Integrated Development Environment (IDEs) –**  
   Vs code (Visual Studio Code), Android Studio, PyCharm, Xcode

## **2\. Benefits of Open Source**

1.  **FLEXIBILITY AND AGILITY**

IT leaders must fundamentally provide flexibility and agility for their enterprise. If you can’t compete on agility, you’re going to get left behind by the competition. Open source enables technology agility, typically offering multiple ways to solve problems. Open source helps keep your IT organization from getting blocked because a particular capability isn’t available from a vendor. Instead of waiting for the vendor to deliver that capability, you can create it yourself.

2. **SPEED**

Your enterprise will soon be competing on speed, if it isn’t already. A great advantage of                       open source is the ability to take the community versions, get started, understand whether they can solve your business problem, and begin to deliver value right away. Once you make that determination, professional support and services are increasingly available for open source products, especially those supported by Red Hat.

3. **COST-EFFECTIVENESS**

Open source is generally much more cost-effective than a proprietary solution. Not only are open source solutions typically much more inexpensive in an enterprise environment for equivalent or superior capability, but they also give enterprises the ability to start small and scale (more on that coming up). Given that enterprises are often budget challenged, it 
                        ust makes financial sense to explore open source solutions.

4.  **ABILITY TO START SMALL**

With open source, you can start small and quickly with community versions, and then migrate to a commercially-supported solution as your business requirements drive you there. If the project doesn’t require support, you can continue on the community version indefinitely. You have the option to try the various alternatives, pick the one that’s going to work, and then scale up with a commercial solution.  

5. **SOLID INFORMATION SECURITY**

Commercial open source has a solid information security record in a dangerous world. Obviously, it’s difficult to claim security superiority for any solution and it’s a challenging environment for all of us, but the responsiveness of the open source community and vendors relative to information security problems has been very good. The fact that we’ve had eyes on code that in some cases is decades old, and we were able to identify and fix problems when they became apparent, rather than have the code molder in a proprietary environment where few knew about the exposure but some were exploiting it, is an advantage of open source.

6.  **ATTRACT BETTER TALENT**

Open source gives enterprises the ability to attract better talent. Most professional technologists are well aware of open source and many believe it’s where the industry is headed. Many enjoy creating their own projects and having the ability to interact with others outside their enterprise to develop solutions. Giving developers flexibility and freedom can be an important tool in attracting batter talent.

7. **SHARE MAINTENANCE COSTS**

You can solve your enterprise problems while effectively sharing some of the maintenance costs. One of the fundamental advantages of open source is community involvement. Rather than writing an application and having to sustain it yourself, you can share the cost of maintaining and sustaining applications among.

## **3\. Open Source vs. Proprietary Software**

**Difference between Open-source Software and Proprietary Software:**

| S.No. | OPEN-SOURCE SOFTWARE | PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE |
| :---: | ----- | ----- |
| **01\.** | Open-source software is computer software whose source code is available openly on the internet and programmers can modify it to add new features and capabilities without any cost. | Proprietary software is computer software where the source codes are publicly not available only the company which has created can modify it. |
| **02\.** | Here the software is developed and tested through open collaboration. | Here the software is developed and tested by the individual or organization by which it is owned not by the public. |
| **03\.** | In open-source software the source code is public. | In proprietary software, the source code is protected. |
| **04\.** | Open-source software can be installed on any computer. | Proprietary software can not be installed into any computer without a valid license. |
| **05\.** | Users do not need to have any authenticated license to use this software. | Users need to have a valid and authenticated license to use this software. |
| **06\.** | Open-source software is managed by an open-source community of developers. | Proprietary software is managed by a closed team of individuals or groups that developed it. |
| **07\.** | It is more flexible and provides more freedom which encourages innovation. | It is not very flexible so there is a very limited innovation scope with the restrictions. |
| **08\.** | Users can get open software free of charge. | Users must have to pay to get the proprietary software. |
| **09\.** | In open-source software faster fixes of bugs and better security are availed due to the community. | In proprietary software, the vendor is completely responsible for fixing malfunctions. |
| **10\.** | Limited Intellectual Property Protections | Full Intellectual Property Protections |
| **11\.** | Usually Developed and Maintained by non-profit organizations. | Usually Developed and Maintained by for-profit entities. |
| **12\.** | Examples are Android, Linux, Firefox, Open Office, GIMP, VLC Media player, etc. | Examples are Windows, macOS, Internet Explorer, Google Earth, Microsoft Office, Adobe Flash Player, Skype, etc. |

 Office requires a paid license but offers better support.

## **5\. Open Source Licensing**

Open-source licenses allow people to use, modify, and share software legally. Different licenses have different rules.

Popular open source licenses include the Apache License, the MIT License, the  GNU General Public License

(GPL), the BSD Licenses, theGNU Lesser General Public License

(LGPL) and the  Mozilla Public License (MPL).



## **6\. How to Contribute to Open Source**

Contributing to open source means helping improve free software, whether by coding, fixing bugs, writing documentation, or testing.

1. Finding Open Source Projects – Websites like GitHub, GitLab, and Open Source Guides list projects you can join. Start with beginner-friendly ones\!  
2. Understanding Version Control (Git, GitHub) – Git helps track code changes, and GitHub is a platform where developers collaborate.  
3. Submitting Pull Requests – When you improve code, you submit a "pull request" to suggest changes. If approved, your work gets added to the project.  
4. Best Practices for Open Source Contribution – Follow project guidelines, write clean code, test your changes, and be respectful in discussions.
